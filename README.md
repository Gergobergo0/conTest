## Holographic Microscope Focus Estimation â€“ Neural Network Challenge

As part of a competition supported by **HUN-REN SZTAKI**, our goal was to develop a deep learning system capable of estimating the absolute focus distance of cells from images captured by a holographic microscope.  
The task was a **regression problem**, evaluated using **root mean squared error (RMSE)**.
